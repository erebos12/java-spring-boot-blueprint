# Blueprint for JAVA Spring Boot Application

Running SpringBoot app, including gradle and docker build, with your own naming and initial git commit. No need to code anything for that.

**Clone and run script:**

```
    $> ./init_app.sh
```

What is this script doing?
1. Replaces all required strings in the files/folders with your name
2. Creates an initial git commit for your app
